(theoretical) 15.0-15.5b4 checkm8-based "jailbreak"

## Warning: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS WHATSOEVER, OK? IF U MESS UP AND NEED TO RESTORE, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

### What does it do now?
Well, for now it installs Procursus rootless bootstrap into /var/jb and drops a loader app into tips.app. From there you can install app-based DEB tweaks ( not all work atm ) and trollstore ( with permission from opa334 ) and NewTerm2

### What does it NOT do?
tweak injection ( which means that you cant run tweak-tweaks )

sileo

stability

### ok this is all fun and games but how do i run this?
Please, dont come to me asking for help, as I've stated multiple times its meant to be DEV ONLY. If u want a more usable jailbreak, check out geosn0w's jailbreak.

( i will add instructions once i push the code )

### FAQ:
#### Why jailbreak in quotes?
Because it isnt a full jailbreak, it doesnt have Sileo / Libhooker for example. This is like the bare minimum.

#### How do i install tweaks?
You can install tweaks by using the loader app, press the install from url button, and enter the URL to a deb.

#### Where is the code?
I still need to add the finishing touches to it, this will take maybe 4 - 6 days or something, once thats done I'll publish it here.
